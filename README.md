# Diabetes Prediction System

This is a simple Machine Learning project for predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to train an SVM model to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain medical features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Usage

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to:

- Load and explore the dataset.
- Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, feature scaling).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train an SVM classifier on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
- Make predictions using the trained model.

Feel free to customize the notebook and experiment with different hyperparameters or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's accuracy.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by:
